\title{Calculate the win probability using OLS estimators}
\usage{
winprob_ols(data, home, away, home_effect = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{List of season data as produced by XY_differences, contains
design matrix X, scores Y_diff, and a list of teams}

\item{home}{Name of the home team, could be a substring}

\item{away}{Name of the away team, could be a substring}

\item{home_effect}{Logical, indicates if there is home field advantage}

\item{verbose}{Logical, indicates if we want output to read win probabilities}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the teams and their win probabilities
}
\description{
Calculate the win probability using OLS estimators

\examples{
G <- regssn2021
List <- XY_differences(G)
