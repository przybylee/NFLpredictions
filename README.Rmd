# NFLpredictions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package functions that make make it easy to analyze betting lines for NFL games.

## Installation

You can install the development version of NFLpredictions from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("przybylee/NFLpredictions")
```

## Example

Suppose we are considering placing a wager on a first round playoff game between the Cardinals and the Rams.

```{r example}
library(NFLpredictions)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
