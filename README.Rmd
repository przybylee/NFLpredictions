# NFLpredictions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package functions that make make it easy to analyze betting lines for NFL games.

## Installation

You can install the development version of NFLpredictions from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("przybylee/NFLpredictions")
```

## Example

Suppose we are considering placing a wager on a first round playoff game between the Cardinals and the Rams.

![Alt text](README_images/SampleBettingLine.PNG)

First we load the library and collect some data.  We will scrape scores from all the games from the 2021 regular season from [Pro-Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/).

```{r example}
library(NFLpredictions)
G <- scrape_games(ssn = 2021, wk_start = 1, wk_stop = 18)
head(G)
tail(G)

```

Next, we want to use linear regression to estimate the relative strengths of each team.  We can use a simple model, where $Y_j$ is the margin of victory for the home team in game $j$.  Then we have

$$
y_j = \tau_{h_j} - \tau_{a_j} + \eta + \varepsilon_j,
$$

where $\varepsilon_j$ is observed as the residuals in our model.  The indices $h_j$ and $a_j$ indicate the home and away teams respectively.  The effect of home field advantage is represented by $\eta$.  The matrix equation associated with this is 

$$
X\pmb{\beta} = \mathbf{y},
$$
where 
$$
\pmb{\beta} = (\eta,\tau_1,...,\tau_{32})'
$$
The design matrix $X$ has a row for each game in the data set, where each row has a 1 in the first column, a 1 in column $h_j$, and a $-1$ in column $a_j$.  We cannot estimate $\pmb{\beta}$ directly, but we can estimate $\eta$ as well as the difference of any two $\tau$'s using ordinary least squares.  This serves as a good predictor for the outcome of a game.  Given a data frame of games resembling `G`, we can produce the appropriate $X$ and $\mathbf{y}$ using the function `XY_differences()`.
```{r}
data <- XY_differences(G)
names(data)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
